# linalg
Collection of functions for handling common linear algebra. Especially for certain use cases that make 3rd-party libraries troublesome.

The intent of this repository is to serve as a centralized location from which I can re-use linear algebra code that I have written for situations such as writing programs that must be compiled by COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS' compiler where it is much easier to write programs that exist within a single class. For serious Linear algebra code you should use something like Apache Commons Math.
